# Microspacing Vancouver Discord Bot

> Note: This project was developed during Microsoft Vancouver's 2024 Hackathon!

A Discord bot that automates the management of Microspacing Vancouver (MSV) events.

## What the Bot Does

- **Monitors Event Registrations**: Checks the number of entrants for MSV events on Start.gg using a configurable event URL.
- **Creates Waitlist Threads**: Automatically creates a new waitlist thread in the MSV Discord server when the entrant cap is reached (default: 32, but configurable).
- **Locks Previous Threads**: Locks the previous waitlist thread every Tuesday, notifying users with a message that a new one will be created once the next event caps.
- **Announcements**: Posts an announcement every Wednesday morning, providing registration details and encouraging attendees to bring setups.
- **Administrator Commands**: Provides commands for admins to control and configure the bot's behavior.
- **Testing and Cleanup**: Includes commands for testing the bot's functionality and resetting its state for accurate operation.

## Note on Tokens and Deployment

The Start.gg token this bot uses (i.e., `waitlist-bot` in the Dantotto profile) was created around October 2024. The token should be updated around August 2025 at the latest by changing the `.env` file in the deployed Ubuntu server and re-running PM2 with the following command:

```bash
pm2 restart 6 --update-env
```
