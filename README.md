## Note on Tokens and Deployment

The Start.gg token this bot uses (i.e., `waitlist-bot` in the Dantotto profile) was created around October 2024. The token should be updated around August 2025 at the latest by changing the `.env` file in the deployed Ubuntu server and re-running PM2 with the following command:

```bash
pm2 restart <some num> --update-env
```
